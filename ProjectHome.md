Boks is an AIR application (so it works on Windows, Mac and Linux) that provides a User Interface for Blueprint CSS's framework. It's been designed for those who think the Grid System is good but never really took the time to give it love.

It handles grid configuration, baseline rhythm pimpin', CSS (with or without compression) and grid.png export, HTML layout and much more goodie-goodie!

Want more? Sure! You can also provide your own CSS files and other assets to be used in addition with the generated CSS and HTML!
